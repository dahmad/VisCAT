# VisCAT - Visual Code Auditing Tool

A tool to gain a visual grasp over a repository and its contents.

This is an addition to a series of toy projects to challenge me to learn new languages and frameworks.

For this project, I intend to use Ruby on Rails for the backend and React and d3.js for the front end. For front-end tests, I want to try TestCafe.

### Requirements
* As a user I want to be able to paste a URL to a public repository
* AAUIW to be able to see a graph of the project structure
* AAUIW to be able to expand or collapse the graph as I see fit
* AAUIW to see a difference in color or shape between files and directories
* AAUIW to see a difference in color or shape between files of different types
* AAUIW to be given hints of what files contain (e.g. X number of functions are defined within this specific file)
* AAUIW to see where functions defined in one place are called from within other (or the same) file
* AAUIW a legend that explains what different colors and shapes represent
* AAUIW to be able to use keyboard shortcuts to navigate the visualization
* AUUIW a legend that explains keyboard shortcuts
* AAUIW to see a visual display to the results of a `grep`
